# Dose_Objective_Check

This program is for use with ARIA/Eclipse, which is a commerical radiation treatment planning software suite made by Varian Medical Systems which is used in Radiation Oncology. This is one of several programs which I have made while working in the Radiation Oncology department at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. I have licensed it under GPL V3 so it is open-source and publicly available.

There is a .docx README file that describes what the program does and how it is organized.

Dose Objective Check is an ESAPI script for external beam radiation plan evaluation. It assesses the Organ-at-risk (OAR) dose objectives for a plan and then pulls DVH information from Eclipse to determine if the dose objectives are passing. It generates PDF reports of this analysis. Please see the .docx readme file in the repo for more information.
